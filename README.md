# ü•¨ Harvst Watermate for Home Assistant
A custom compontent for Home Assistant to add support for the Harvst Watermate and Sprout greenhouses.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èThis is an unofficial integration and is not supported by [Harvst](https://www.harvst.co.uk/)

This is an attempt to pull data and control the local web interface of the Harvst Watermate into Home Assistant.

üöß I have only tested this on my Sprout S24.

## Currently Supported Functions
- 1x Temperature Sensor
- Switch 3 outputs on/off
- Monitoring Pump Running State - _Requires Firmware 2024061702_
